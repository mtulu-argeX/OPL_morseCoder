# OPL_morseCoder
Morse code generator app for old Ericsson MC218. The MC218 is a rebranded versin of PSION Series 5mx. MC218 has an OPL compiler. OPL stands for Open Programing Language. It is invented by PSION LTD. The language iterated from BASIC language. 

Once it runs Morse Codder expect a text from the user. Than, program converts the text into hearable morse code form the MC218's speaker. On later versions, I will add RS232 interface option. It will be possible to send the morse code over a radio.
